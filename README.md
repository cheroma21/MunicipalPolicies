| Economic Clusters              | Economy | Identify economic clusters—groups of firms in a particular industry—in the area that are growing or poised for growth. Research how these clusters function and why they succeed, and consult with members of the cluster to identify gaps and service needs that local service providers can fill to strengthen the cluster and further ground it in the local community                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Workforce Development          | Economy | Target economic development efforts to firms in these clusters and their supply chains. Encourage and facilitate clusters by working with local education and training institutions to develop workforce skills and continually promote workforce training. Skill-development policies should be oriented toward filling discrete skill gaps in the local labor market that could otherwise inhibit cluster development.                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Supply Chain Strengthening     | Economy | Work with priority firms and/or clusters to map their supply chains. Identify opportunities for existing local businesses within these supply chains and gaps where there are no local businesses. Focus economic development on attracting or growing businesses that can fit into these supply chains.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Ongoing Workforce Training     | Economy | Identify, organize, and work with employers in a regional labor market to meet their shared needs. Pay particular attention to a region’s best employers; work with unions whenever possible to help identify and organize key sectors; and work on skill, retention, and advancement inside the firm, not just on connecting workers to the first rung in the ladder. Include shorter-term training options, which integrate basic and occupational skills, and are offered when lowwage workers can get to class. |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Municipal Training             | Economy | Establish a training academy to train municipal employees on modern skills, but also open the class up to the public for low/no fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Low-income Traing Support      | Economy | Fund or otherwise support organizations that connect low-income individuals with training and support that allows them to complete college-level credentials in growing local industry sectors, as well as secure and retain good jobs. Such training and support includes case management, job-readiness training, college navigation, housing, child care, and transportation, among others.                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Economic ROI                   | Economy | Identify public projects that are good candidates for investment because they require upfront capital but provide revenue or savings over time. Examples will likely include infrastructure projects such as water and sewer systems, landfills, and parking facilities, energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and housing developments.                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Investment Guidelines          | Economy | Create guidelines for using city-controlled investments, such as pension funds, to finance these types of projects. Guidelines should include the percentage of the total that may be invested in economically targeted investments, a transparent process to choose or solicit projects, job-quality guidelines, and policies excluding projects that harm public-sector jobs.                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Municipal Investment Fund      | Economy | Create common investment vehicles with which various entities—public and private pension funds, university endowments, and socially responsible investors, among others—can invest in ETI projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Anchor Org Procurement         | Economy | Leverage the purchasing power of anchor institutions by setting local purchasing goals for contracting and procurement and including job-quality requirements, including wage and benefits standards, in their contracts. Local governments should work with anchors to map their supply chains and redirect business to local and responsible firms.                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Hire Local                     | Economy | Establish a program to promote hiring residents from surrounding neighborhoods. This program could include job fairs, a drop-in recruiting center, training in resume writing and interview skills, or free professional development to current employees.

| Subsidy Clawbacks              | Economy | Attach and enforce clawback provisions that allow governments to hold recipients of subsidies accountable if they fail to meet their promised economicdevelopment goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Prioritize Local Procurement   | Economy | Procurement should prioritize local parish businesses before buying similar product from different parish. Currently we spend $3M/year in Covington on cars. Those should be bought in EBR owned dealerships. We need to set rules that continue to buy from our own parish if bid is within a certain % threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Land Bank                             | Homelessness / Affordable Housing | Create a land bank that focuses on the conversion of vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties into productive uses such as affordable housing, urban gardens, local businesses, and parks.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The Genesee County Land Bank in Michigan is a great example of this. |
| Update Building Codes for Mass Timber | Homelessness / Affordable Housing | Update building codes to include development of mass timber buildings. These are better for environment and more cost effective, and can take use of bountiful Louisiana timber resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                      |
| Residential Infill Program            | Homelessness / Affordable Housing | Modify zoning laws to legalize up to four homes on almost any residential lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Portland                                                             |

| Infrastructure Retrofit Funding         | Infrastructure | Develop creative funding structures to support infrastructure investment and green retrofits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Babylon, New York; Sonoma County, California; and Seattle, Washington, all have interesting programs that have done this. |
| Water Management Planning               | Infrastructure | Require ALL construction in the city to somehow improve drainage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Netherlands                                                                                                               |
| Rewrite Zoning Codes                    | Infrastructure | Rewrite zoning codes and comprehensive plans to require a mixture of usesand densities that foster travel by foot, bike, and transit. Cities can go a step further and decline to regulate uses, and instead simply regulate the form that development should take, with rules on height, mass, and other physical elements, but not on the type of use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                           |
| Eliminate Parking Minimums              | Infrastructure | Reduce or eliminate minimum parking requirements, allow multiple sites to share parking spaces, and impose parking maximums. Cities can price parking to remove an incentive to drive and ensure adequate parking supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                           |
| Land Use - Transportation Coordination  | Infrastructure | Plan land use and transportation together, so that they support and reinforce each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                           |
| Fix-it-first Policies                   | Infrastructure | Adopt “fix-it-first” policies that emphasize the preventative maintenance and repair of existing infrastructure over infrastructure expansion. These policies focus on maintaining and repairing existing streets, bridges, and other transportation infrastructure rather than spending money on expansion or new facilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                           |
| Complete Streets Policies               | Infrastructure | Adopt complete streets policies or ordinances requiring the installation of bicycle, pedestrian, and transit accommodations on any new or reconstructed roadway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                           |
| Impact Fees                             | Infrastructure | Ensure that developers pay for pedestrian, transit, and bicycle infrastructure through development impact fees, in addition to the sewers, street lights, and other infrastructure normally paid for with these fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                           |
| Transportation Funding                  | Infrastructure | Establish long-term, dedicated, sustainable funding streams for public transportation. Consider creating a Regional Transportation District to provide long-range planning, system build out, operations, and financial-management support for transit-system expansion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                           |
| Connected Street Networks               | Infrastructure | Require new developments to build connected street networks, include transit service, accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists, and incorporate a mixture of residential, employment, and commercial uses. These will make transit a feasible and more appealing alternative to single-occupancy vehicle trips.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                           |
| Transit Partnerships                    | Infrastructure | Develop partnerships between transit systems, municipalities, educational institutions, and local businesses to implement subsidized transit passes, guaranteed-ride-home programs, and limits on the availability of subsidized car parking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                           |
| Freight Zoning                          | Infrastructure | Work with private-sector industries to identify locations with access to key highways, rail, water corridors, and/or airports where freight-related businesses can be clustered and enact zoning ordinances to prevent nonindustrial uses in these areas. Cities can use zoning to protect land around ports and rail terminals from full residential and commercial development as this can push freight-reliant industries to the urban periphery or cause land-use conflicts related to freight’s noise, dust, and pollution.                                         |                                                                                                                           |
| Freight Road Restrictions               | Infrastructure | Restrict the use of certain roads by commercial vehicles or vehicles over a certain weight or dimensions, and designate truck routes in core areas to provide better mobility for pedestrians and bicyclists on nontruck routes. Strategies should be developed to reduce congestion and smooth freight pickup and delivery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                           |
| Limit Idling                            | Infrastructure | Enact restrictions limiting idling to five minutes or less. Most idling restrictions provide exemptions in extreme temperatures, for vehicles using their engine to power auxiliary equipment, or other reasons.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                           |
| Freight Fleet Maintenance               | Infrastructure | Make sure that ports and trucking companies clean up their fleets, reduce air pollution, and treat workers fairly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                           |
| Parks Access                            | Infrastructure | Create a plan to increase the quantity and quality of parkland in the city and to ensure that every resident has access to a park. Cities can create new parks in derelict parking lots, on abandoned industrial sites, over highways, and on unused surfaces such as rooftops. New trails can be created on unused—and not useable in the future—railroad lines. Brownfield cleanup grant money or other grant funding can be used to repurpose brownfields into community gardens or parks. When creating new parks, consider the equity of park placement and access. |                                                                                                                           |
| Open Streets                            | Infrastructure | Temporarily or permanently close streets in or adjacent to parks, creating new space, and temporarily close downtown or major routes to create “open streets” available for nonmotorized use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                           |
| Park Hours                              | Infrastructure | Extend park hours and provide lighting—to sports fields and hiking trails, among others—to increase the use of existing parks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                           |
| Park Funding                            | Infrastructure | Use a mix of general city revenue, bonding, philanthropy, corporate contributions, and special taxes—often sales taxes—to fund new parks. Cities can charge developers of new residential or commercial buildings a fee related to their impact on the parks system, and use the funding to improve the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                           |
| Tree Inventory                          | Infrastructure | Protect and nurture existing trees on public property—mostly street trees and in parks—and plant more when possible. Conduct tree inventories, including data on the age, health, and species of each tree on public property, and develop an urban forest master plan, including a goal of increasing canopy cover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                           |
| Tree Planting Incentives                | Infrastructure | Incentivize private tree planting, potentially by offering utility rebates for those who plant trees that will shade their houses, reducing electricity demand. Enlist citizens to help maintain city trees by offering training and support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                           |
| Park Jobs Program                       | Infrastructure | Leverage parks systems to train and employ unemployed or underemployed individuals—including youth or those from low-income backgrounds—via responsible programs that pay decent wages. Provide training in parksmaintenance skills in conjunction with life-skills instruction and connections to future career opportunities such as arborists and landscapers.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                           |
| Waste Management Procurement            | Infrastructure | Adopt purchasing policies with a recycled content preference, and replace disposables with reusables or recyclables. Require or give preference to vendors with take-back policies for products that are difficult to dispose of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                           |
| Curbside Recycling                      | Infrastructure | Require residents and businesses to participate in curbside pickup recycling programs. Mandatory programs with financial penalties for noncompliance greatly increase recycling rates and are particularly useful with multifamily, large commercial, and institutional properties, especially when coupled with educational programs for tenants and building managers.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                           |
| Event Waste Management                  | Infrastructure | Require large public events to provide both garbage and recycling services to their attendees, and provide guidance on how best to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                           |
| City Construction Recycling             | Infrastructure | Require recycling in all city construction and demolition projects, and require construction or demolition projects of reasonable size to submit recycling plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                           |
| Retail Take it Back Program             | Infrastructure | Require manufacturers to take responsibility for their products from cradleto grave through “retail-take-it-back” programs. Cities should also ban the disposal of electronic waste in landfills, and provide a consumer electronics collection program if a take-back program is not available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                           |
| Curbside Organic Waste Pickup           | Infrastructure | Make the curbside collection of organic waste—yard waste and food scraps, for example—mandatory for residences, institutions, and businesses. Process the collected materials in a biodigester and use or sell the products— natural gas and fertilizer, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                           |
| Biogas Utilization                      | Infrastructure | Capture biogases from landfills and use them to generate electricity or to<br>operate vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                           |
| Watershed Protection                    | Infrastructure | Protect drinking-water quality through a combination of watershed protection, minimizing pollutants, water treatment, and contaminant monitoring. Protecting water sources involves mapping the zone from which a well draws water, identifying contaminant sources in that area, and planning interventions to address each of them                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                           |
| Greywater International Plumbing Code   | Infrastructure | Adopt the International Plumbing Code and Uniform Plumbing Code to legalize greywater from showers and washing to be used to flush toilets and for irrigation. Require residential buildings to be constructed to include greywater accommodations, including separate pipes for sink, shower, and bathtub drains, and an outdoor connection for laundry greywater to allow landscaping use.                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                           |
| Storm-water Planning                    | Infrastructure | Approach storm-water planning systematically and comprehensively. Include representatives from all relevant departments—water, sewerage, storm water, and even transportation and fire departments—to reach the most efficient and widely accepted solutions. Such planning should look at public and private property, and should consider solutions based in buildings (green roofs or rain barrels), streets (vegetated curb extensions and sidewalk planters), and landscaping (rain gardens).                                                        |                                                                                                                           |
| Storm-water Fees                        | Infrastructure | Base storm-water fees on how much of the property is developed, andcharge high enough rates to incentivize porous surfaces. Collect storm-water fees from all properties including parking lots, even if they’re not connected to the drinking-water system. Waive or significantly reduce these fees if wetlands, rain barrels, green roofs, pervious pavement, or other green infrastructure are installed.                                                                                                                                               | Philadelphia                                                                                                              |
| Water and Waste Water Conservation Fees | Infrastructure | Charge 2x-3x more to highest volume users instead of offering discount. Discourage high-user to encourage more conservation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | San Antonio                                                                                                               |
